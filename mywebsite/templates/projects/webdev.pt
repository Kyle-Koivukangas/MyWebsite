                This particular website is built with a Python (Pyramid) backend. I'm using Pyramid handlers for view controllers and chameleon for the template language.
                The groundwork has been written for a full user account system with a SQLite database, password encryption/hashing and cookie authentication, 
                I just haven't built the font-end for it yet.

                The projects page layout was made with plain old CSS grids, the HTML for each page is loaded in the background 
                via AJAX call which allows javascript to seemlessly insert HTML for page changes; it acts like a "single page app", complete with transtion animations 
                and URL hashing to keep track of the page. I wrote a script that extracts the HTML from the templates for each project page at server startup. This information is saved
                to a JSON file which is what is served to the user when they load the projects page. That's how I have a single page app within a template-based website.
